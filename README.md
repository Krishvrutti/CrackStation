# CrackStation

A description of this package.
we have created a crackstation package where we use the encrypted hash values that we got by creating a program for the sha1 and stored it in a lookup table ie,the data.json file and then we use the decrypt function that is used to take the hash value of the string upto 2 variables to give the string as the output.we have tried different test cases and combinations to make sure that the user is giving the hash value of the data present in the look up table and if it doesnt then we get nil.some one can use it to maintain security as the hash value is kept by them and if and only if they input the value they get their desired output.the public API that is used in this is decrypter that as mentioned used to decrypt the given hash values.the tag version is 1.0.1
